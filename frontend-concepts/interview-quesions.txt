1) JSON.stringify v/s structuredClone 
 structuredClone advantages:
 - structuredClone can handle circular references 
 - Date, Map, Set are preserved 
 - faster for complex objects 
 Use JSON.stringify for simple JSON compatible data (API payload, response)

2) Retry with exponential backoff 
 - Refer to fetchWithAutoRetry.js

3) Avoid updating state of unmounted components - AbortController 

4) Implement a custom debounce JS function 
 - Refer to pollyfills.js 
 
5) How to avoid full app re-render on theme change? 
 - Use CSS variables instead of React layer
 - useSyncExternalStore 

    // Without any React re-render
    useEffect(() => {
        document.documentElement.setAttribute("data-theme", theme);
    }, [theme]);

    /* CSS */
    :root[data-theme="light"] {
    --bg-color: #fff;
    --text-color: #000;
    }

6) CommonJS          v/s    ES Module 
   require, exports       import/export
   synchronous            asynchronous
   cached by default      not cached by default 
   useful in server-side  both client & server side
   (Node)
   dynamic import X       supports dynamic import 
                          (useful for lazy or conditional loading)
   Tree shaking X         tree shaking is supported 
   Legacy NodeJS projects Modern Node JS BE projects with "type": "module"
                          frontend apps with webpack, vite, Next.js 

Note: Old jest.config and eslint.config before Node 20 supported only CommonJS with module.exports syntax 

7) Write a function compose(fn1, fn2, fn3...) that performs function composition — i.e.,
compose(f, g, h)(x) should return f(g(h(x))).

8) Implement a deepClone(obj) function that can clone nested objects, arrays, and handles circular references.
 - Refer to deepClone.js

9) Custom functions for:
 - Promise.all 
 - bind 

10) Redux toolkit:
    - createSlice (auto-generates actions & reducers)
    - RTK Query - createAPI 
      -> createApi slice has reducer and  middleware
      -> defines base url, endpoints, caching behaviour
      -> auto-generates hooks based on query name 
         (useGetUsersQuery/useAddUsersMutation)      
    - createAsyncThunk
       -> built on top of Redux thunk 
       -> automatically generates pending, fulfilled, rejected actions 

11) script normal v/s async v/s defer 

Script = HTML parsing + (parsing paused) JS download + JS execution + Resume HTML parsing 
script async = HTML parsing and JS download parallelly + (parsing paused) JS execution + Resume HTML parsing (order is not maintained, the one downloaded first is executed first)
script defer = HTML parsing full and JS download parallelly + JS execution (maintains order)
