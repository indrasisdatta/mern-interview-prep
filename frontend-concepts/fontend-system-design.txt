How to check code quality and PR quality? 

- Automated code quality checks: 
  - ESLint and prettier rules check using husky and lint-staged
  - Unit testing using Jest, RTL. Enforce minimum code coverage threshold. 
  - CI/CD pipeline integration with linting stage, testing stage, code coverage stage 

- Code review checklist:
  - Check functionality, edge cases and error scenarios 
    Proper error handling, over-use of useState (useReducer instead)
  - Code style (Adhere to ESLint, Prettier rules and Follow team-defined coding standards)
  - Performance check efficient DOM update and minimum re-render (use React Profiler)
  - Adhere to WVAG guidelines for Accesibility (use tools like axe-core)
  - For security, XSS prevention - sanitize user inputs 


Code review examples:

1) Approach 1: <input onClick={handleClick} />  
   Approach 2: <input onClick={() => handleClick()} />
Ans: 1 is better as the reference remains the same across re-renders. 
     2 creates a new arrow function each time the component is re-rendered. This can increase memory usage and affect performance. 

2) setCount(count + 1);
Ans: Change to setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);
    State updates are asyncrhonous, so frequent updates can show incorrect results. 

3) Missing key in map -  items.map((item) => <div>{item}</div>);
Ans:  items.map((item) => <div key={item.id}>{item}</div>);
