Loading time includes:
 - TTFB (Time to first byte) 
 - FCP (First contentful paint)
 - LCP (Last contentful paint)
 - TTI (Time to interactive) 
 
How to improve TTFB? (Goal: Process server request fast and deliver to client fast)
 - Use CDN to serve static files
 - Optimize server side processing (eg. DB queries) 
 - Optimize DNS lookup times with DNS prefetching 
 - Enable compression (Gzip, Brotli) to reduce response size 
 - Use Redis to cache heavy responses 
 - Use HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 for multiplexing or lower latency 
 - Reduce HTTP overhead by minimizing headers and cookies 

How to improve FCP? (Pre-loading or cache for above-the-fold content i.e before scollbar content and lazy load the rest)
