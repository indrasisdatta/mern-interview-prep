1. Global execution context is created when JS file starts running. 
   It has 2 parts - memory and thread of execution
2. Memory creation phase 
   - memory is allocated to variables and functions   
   - variables are set to undefined 
   - functions declarations are stored as full function definitions
3. Execution phase - assign values to variables. 
   If a function is there, create a new Execution context for the function. 
   Push the Function exec context (FEC) onto the call stack
   Then have memory creation and execution phases for that function.
   Function execution phase - executes the func body.
   Context is popped out of the stack.

let a = 1;
let b = 2;
function add(x, y) {
    let total = x + y;
    return total;
}
let result1 = add(a, b);
let result2 = add(10, 5);

Call stack - Code is stored line by line (first GEC, then let a and so on)

--------------

BigInt 
Number range is -(2^53 - 1) to 2^53 - 1. 
If we need to assign a value beyond this range, then we should opt for BigInt. 
let a = 2 ** 54;   // Number (might lose precision)
let b = 2n ** 54n; // BigInt (exact)

Symbol 
- don't appear in for in loop, Objet.keys, JSON.stringify 
- can be used as object keys to assign unique identifier


---------------------------

const obj = {
   dev: 'ABC',
   d: function() {
   return (() => {
      return this.dev; // inherits parent this 
   })()
   }
}

obj.d() // ABC 

Type cooertion:
 Number(undefined) = NaN 
 Number(null) = 0 
 null == 0 // false (null is only loosely equal to undefined and nothing else)
 null >= 0 ->  !(null > 0) !false = true 
 null <= 0 -> !(null < 0) !false = true 

For + => if any is not a number, all are converted to string 
For - => all operands are converted to numbers 

[].toString(); // ""
[1].toString(); // "1" returns the number irrespective of how nested it is
({}).toString(); // [object Object]
Number([]); // 0
Number([1]); // 1 returns the number irrespective of how nested it is
Number({}); // NaN
