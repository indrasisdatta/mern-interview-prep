MICRO FRONTEND (MODULE FEDERATION) – LIMITATIONS & REMEDIES

1) Shared State Management

    Problem:
        Global Redux across micro frontends is hard to manage
        Causes tight coupling between apps

    Remedies: Keep state local to each micro frontend
    Communicate using:
        Custom browser events
        RxJS event bus
        URL state or backend as source of truth

2) CSS Conflicts

    Problem: Styles can leak between micro frontends

    Remedies:
        CSS Modules
        Scoped CSS / BEM
        Shadow DOM (when suitable)
        Shared design system or design tokens

3) CI/CD Complexity

    Problem:
        Each micro frontend needs its own pipeline
        Deployment coordination becomes complex

    Remedies:
        Independent CI/CD per micro frontend
        Backward-compatible contracts
        Clear ownership per team

4) Initial Load Performance

    Problem:
        Multiple remote entry files
        Network request waterfall

    Remedies:
        Lazy load micro frontends
        Preload critical remotes
        Use CDN caching
        Share common dependencies carefully

5) Version Compatibility

    Problem:
        React or shared library version mismatch
        Breaking changes at runtime

    Remedies:
        Strict versioning rules
        Semantic versioning
        Minimize shared dependencies

6) Debugging Complexity

    Problem:
        Errors span across multiple apps
        Harder stack traces and source maps

    Remedies:
        Enable source maps
        Centralized logging and monitoring
        Error boundaries per micro frontend

7) Runtime Failures

    Problem:
        Remote app unavailable
        Bad deployment breaks host at runtime

    Remedies:
        Graceful fallbacks
        Feature flags
        Timeout and retry logic

8) Over-Engineering Risk
    Problem: Too much complexity for small teams or apps

    Remedy: Use micro frontends only when:
        Multiple teams are involved
        Independent deployments are required
        Product is large and long-lived

SUMMARY:
Micro frontends scale teams and deployments but increase architectural
and operational complexity. Use them only when scale demands it.
