NodeJS 24 latest features

Node JS process 

Main thread:
 - init project 
 - top level code 
 - require module 
 - event callback register
 - start event loop 
 - offload CPU intensive tasks to thread pool (File system, Crypto (encrypt/decrypt, Compression)

Event loop phases:
1) Timers: Expired timer callbacks setTimeout, setInterval 
2) Pending callbacks: callbacks that couldn't be executed in the previous loop iteration are executed here
3) Poll: I/O polling FS 
4) Check: setImmediate() callback 
5) close callbacks (server/socket close CB)
Any tasks pending? true then exit, otherwise restart event loop 

Promise callback - executed during event loop transition 

setTimeout() and setImmediate() order is non-deterministic at top level code. 
Inside I/O callback, setImmediate() is executed first 

Call stack -> process.nextTick() -> promise microtasks -> event loop phases
