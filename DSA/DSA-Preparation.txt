PHASE 1 (Core - MUST master) These cover 70% of interviews.
    Do only these first:
    Hashing
    Sliding Window
    Two Pointers
    Stack & Queue
    Binary Search

    From your list, that's:
    49, 347, 128, 1
    3, 209, 567
    15, 11, 26
    20, 155, 150
    33, 34, 875

    Do not move on until you can solve these without hints.

PHASE 2 (Frontend-Specific Strength)
    This is where your profile shines.
    Trees & Recursion
    Intervals
    Greedy

    These are very common in: Agoda, Flipkart, Swiggy, Razorpay, Atlassian FE roles

PHASE 3 (Senior / System DS)
    Only after Phase 1 + 2 feel comfortable.
    LRU Cache
    Graphs
    DP (only basics)

✅ Right way (what you should do)

For each problem, write 3 things:
    Pattern
    Invariant
    Failure case you missed

Example (Remove K duplicates):
    Pattern: Stack (group compression)
    Invariant: Stack top = unresolved group
    Missed: Need to repeat chars when rebuilding string

This is how you convert attempts → skill.

For each problem:
1) Write the pattern name
2) Write the invariant (1–2 lines)
3) Dry-run 1 example on paper
4) Code
5) Write 1 mistake / edge case learned
